Elvie #135
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #295 of Linux Magazine (June 2025). The Framework company (https://frame.work) was not involved in the creation of this strip in any way - we just thought it made for a good joke. However, we do commend them on the approach they're taking to making modern technology more sustainable.
