Elvie #106
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #266 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, and takes some heavy inspiration from my own history with computers.
I continues using an Atari ST (and later a Falcon) as my main computing device long after they had ceased production, and I was
also a big fan of the Apple Newton (and yes, there is a web server available for it, and it supports PCMCIA ethernet cards). 

File Details
------------
* 106_panel_n.ora         - The original MyPaint image used for panel _n_ in the strip.
