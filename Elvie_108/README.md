Elvie #108
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #268 of Linux Magazine. I can't deny, this is one of my favourite Elvie strips. It took us a little while to get the right combination of objects mirroring each other between the past and present but, together with the play on words, I think the end result is a clever little strip that's a bit different to most of our others.
